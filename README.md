1. make sure you have make installed (you might need brew to install it though)
2. clone the repository on the server
3. create copy .env.example into .env and edit the DATA_PATH variable and other ones
4. run the "make dev" command
5. enjoy



The system is though in a way that you can always reset the whole system to a fresh start with all the services already pre-connected for you
